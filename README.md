# PCA Factor Analysis and Portfolio Optimisation

This project demonstrates how to apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **portfolio optimisation** techniques to analyse stock returns. It enables users to explore their portfolioâ€™s structure and gain a deeper economic understanding of the driving factors behind returns.

## Features

- **Portfolio Optimisation**  
  Calculates expected returns and the covariance matrix between stocks to construct an optimal portfolio that minimises volatility.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Performs dimensionality reduction to identify the key underlying factors affecting portfolio returns, helping to simplify complex data.

- **Economic Intuition of PCA Factors**  
  Each PCA factor is compared against sector ETFs to interpret its real-world economic significance, providing meaningful insights into the portfolio drivers.

## How it works

1. The project analyses historical stock returns data.
2. PCA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset to highlight dominant factors.
3. Portfolio optimisation uses expected returns and covariance to minimise portfolio risk.
4. PCA factors are mapped to sector ETFs for intuitive economic interpretation.
